# Daily Coding Problem 2019-08-08

####  _Good morning! Here's your coding interview problem for today._

_This problem was asked by Facebook._

_Given a string of round, curly, and square open and closing brackets, return whether the brackets are balanced (well-formed)._

_For example, given the string "([])[]({})", you should return true._

_Given the string "([)]" or "((()", you should return false._
